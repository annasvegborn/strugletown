          Hi!<br> 
          I'm Anna. I'm here to tell you the story behind my alter-ego Strugle and her world Strugletown.
          <br>
          <br>
          <u>THE DIARY</u> <br><br>
          Strugle first appeared in 2017 on a diary page. At the time I was studying at the University of Cambridge and was about to 
          break in my brand new Paperblanks diary
          that I had been gifted as a Christmas present. As I was writing about my day I found myself describing all 
          the small problems we face as students. The next day I wrote about studying and having the same problems, for example,
          spending too much time procrastinating. One day I found that I was about to write about these small Cambridge
          struggles yet again and decided to draw them instead of writing about them. <br><br>
          <u>COMICS</u> <br><br>
          Soon I had drawn about two or three typical student struggles. I showed my friends who recognised the struggles and found them funny.
          I decided to put the drawings on Instagram for them to follow. All the comics featured the little character Strugle with blue clothes
          and yellow hair. She got her name from a 
          misspelling of Cambridge Struggles in one of the comics where one 'g' had been left out. We laughed about the mistake 
          and started referring to the character in the comics as Strugle.
          <br><br>
          The account <a href="wwww.instagram.com/cambridgestruggles">@cambridgestruggles</a> was created! The struggles
          that I had as a student could be turned into something positive by turning them into comics which people relate to. 
          As more people found the account I started getting positive comments saying that they were happy to see that they
          were not alone struggling as students. The community that was forming inspired me to do more.

          <u>CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES</u> <br><br>
          Studying in Cambridge was tough, but one thing that always made it better was the beautiful surroundings that I 
          found myself in when going back and forth between lecture halls and libraries. Cambridge
          is a beautiful city with stunning arcitecture. I decided to try to draw one of 
          the castle-like buildings in the same style as the comics and found that it was appreciated by the few followers that 
          my Instagram account had gained. Shortly thereafter my goal was to draw one building from each of the 31 Cambridge colleges.
          This was a time consuming but fun challenge that I finished in January 2021! 
          <br><br>
          <u>MALMO & LUND, SWEDEN</u> <br><br>
          After three years in Cambridge, I moved back to Sweden to continue my studies there. Continuing with the comics about 
          the struggles of being a student felt natural as there was plenty of inspiration to be found at Lund University too.
          I decided to expand the drawings beyond Cambridge and start drawing Malm√∂ (where I now lived) and Lund 
          (where I now studied) too.
          Since these drawings didn't fit the Cambridge theme of the first Instagram account I decided to post these on a new 
          account called <a href="wwww.instagram.com/strugletown">@strugletown</a>, referring to any place where Strugle might be.

          <u>STRUGLETOWN.COM</u> <br><br>
          It became clear that Strugle needed a website where everything Strugle related could be found. Shortly 
          thereafter strugle.com was created and here you are now! I have many creative ideas that I want to explore and I 
          hope that you'll be interested in following what happens here. If you already have a Strugletown product I recommend 
          you head over to the Bonus Content section where you can try stuff like AR filters and more. If you do not, I can recommend 
          heading over to the Shops section where you can get anything from posters and stickers
          to tote bags and colouring pages.
