      <h2>The story behing Strugle</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I am Anna, the creator of Strugle. This is the history behind Strugle.
      </p>
      <h4>The diary</h4>
      <p>
        At the time I was studying at University of Cambridge and was about to break in my brand new paper blanks diary
        that I had been gifted as a Christmas present. As I was writing about my day I found myself complaining a lot
        about small things. The next day I wrote about studying the same topics and having the same problems, for example,
        spending too much time procrastinating. One day I found that I was about to write about these small Cambridge
        struggles yet again and decided to draw them instead of writing. I liked drawing about my day in this comic style. 
        Soon I had drawn about two or three typical student struggles. I showed my friends who enjoyed them and they pushed me 
        to put them on Instagram for them to follow. 
      </p>
      <h4>Instagram</h4>
      <p>
        The account <a href="wwww.instagram.com/cambridgestruggles">@cambridgestruggles</a> was created! For each struggle
        that I had as a student it could be turned into something positive by creating a cartoon which people relate to. 
        As more people found my page I started getting positive comments saying that they were happy that to see that they
        were not alone struggling as students. The community that was forming inspired me to do more.
      </p>
      <h4>Colleges</h4>
      <p>
        When I felt the most stressed about my studies I would always find joy and calm for observing my surroundings. Cambridge
        is a beautiful city with stunning arcitecture. I wanted to portray this aspect of Cambridge in my comics and decided to 
        draw one iconic building of each college. These were enjoyed by students at the colleges.
